# This is Boyang Yu's second portfolio site project.

This project will be using react, to improve the workflow and get access to more tools when building and designing the site.

The first site, with the URL below, is also hosted on github pages.

However, do note that the first site was never completely finished.

This second site is being made because:

1. It makes a good practice for the React library.
2. A new design for the overall looks and structure of the site.

I will work on this site when I have free time to spare, and hopefully the end result will turn out great.
