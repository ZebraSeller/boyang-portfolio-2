# Greetings, this is Boyang Yu's second portfolio site project.

This project is created with react, to improve the workflow and get access to more powerful tools when building and designing the site.

The first site, with the URL below, is also hosted on github pages. (https://zebraseller.github.io/Boyang-Portfolio-Site-Project/)
**!!! However, the first site was never completely finished. !!!**

This second site is being made because:

1. Better Promote myself, my experiences, and my skills.
2. It makes a good practice for learning React.
3. A new design for the overall looks and structure of the site.

I will work on this site when I have free time to spare, and hopefully the end result will turn out great.

Edit 12.1.2021: I think the end result is great.

### Plans:

1. Add Pop-up window with link to experiences/ skills.
2. Add down arrow button on home page that leads to the next sections.
3. Add ability to switch to light mode (Huge Maybe, could take too much time).
