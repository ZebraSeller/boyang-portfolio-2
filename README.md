# Greetings, this is Boyang Yu's second portfolio site project.

This project is created with react, to improve the workflow and get access to more powerful tools when building and designing the site.

The first site, with the URL below, is also hosted on github pages. (https://zebraseller.github.io/Boyang-Portfolio-Site-Project/)
**However, the first site was never completely finished.**

This second site is being made because:

1. It makes a good practice for React.
2. A new design for the overall looks and structure of the website.

I will work on this site when I have free time to spare, and hopefully the end result will turn out great.

Edit 12.1.2021: I think the end result is great.
